Substance Use Disorder Research
===============================

Building on our initial effort to undestand the prevalence of Opioid Use Disorder using capture recapture methods in a highly cited paper in the [`American Journal of Public Health`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30359112/), we have worked to improve methods for prevalence estimation in this hard to reach population. We use **multiple systems data methods** to estimate prevalence in an attempt to understand the size of the population not captured by any data sources.

Spatially granular prevalence estimates
---------------------------------------

We have developed an approach inspired by capture recapture methods to perform small area estimation of prevalence. This fully bayesian approach can estimate prevalence in the presence of sparse data by leveraging spatial correlation between areas. Code for this method is found [`here`](https://github.com/jianing-jenny-wang/SCRC-SAE-HealthAdminData) and the paper describing this is under review.
