Tuberculosis methods
====================

Below are some of our methods developed to assist in understanding TB epidemiology.

TB-STATIS: Measures of tuberculosis disease severity
----------------------------------------------------

Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to infectious disease globally and antibiotic treatment regimens can take months to years to successfully treat the disease. There is growing interest in treatment shortening regimens for individuals with less severe disease. With that in mind, we developed a rigorous statistical approach to estimate TB disease severity using available data at diagnosis and event-based modeling (popular in the study of cognitive decline). Our software is available [`here`](https://github.com/samalatesta/tbSTATISpaper) and the paper is under review.

imputeTBculture: methods to handle missing data in serially collected culture samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In clinical trials and cohort studies of TB, it is common to collect culture samples at multiple time points during follow-up. Missing data is common in these studies and there was no well-established approach to handle this missing data. We have published a [`paper`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-022-01782-8) in *BMC Medical Research Methods* describing best practices for this problem and created [`code`](https://github.com/samalatesta/imputeTBculture) for practitioners to use.
