-About me
-======
I am a biostatistician developing novel methods and approaches to address data driven problems primarily in infectious diseases and substance use disorders. My work primarily focuses on using existing data sets collected for surveillance or research to understand transmission, disease burden and other epidemiological features of interest. I love a good challenge and the opportunity to work on questions that can lead to new insights of medical or public health interest. My team uses a wide range of analytical approaches to tackle problems-we are methods-agnostic and happy to determine the best tool for the problem at hand.

-What we do
-======
We approach problems from a statistical perspective. This means that we are interested in understanding signals in data, carefully considering data generating processes (such as sampling issues), and leveraging the rich toolkits of statistics to develop models. We are also adept at mathematical modeling approaches, model calibration, and a host of other useful techniques.
