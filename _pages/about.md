About me
-======

I am a Professor of Biostatistics at the [`Boston University School of Public Health`](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/laura-white/) where I am the Associate Directore of the [`Center for Health Data Science`](https://sites.bu.edu/healthdatascience/) and direct a Data Science and Surveillance Core in the [`Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases`](https://www.bu.edu/ceid/). I am a part of the CDC/CFA [`Insight Net`](https://www.cdc.gov/insight-net/php/about/index.html) within the [`Epistorm consortium`](https://www.epistorm.org/).

In collaboration with clinician researchers, epidemiologists and public health practitioners, we:

- Develop novel methods and approaches to address data driven problems primarily in infectious diseases and substance use disorders, and
- Focus on using existing data sets collected for surveillance or research to understand transmission, disease burden and other epidemiological features of interest.

I love a good challenge and the opportunity to work on questions that can lead to new insights of medical or public health interest. My team uses a wide range of analytical approaches to tackle problems-we are methods-agnostic and happy to determine the best tool, method or innovation needed for the problem at hand.

What we do
-======

We approach problems from a statistical perspective. This means that we are interested in understanding signals in data, carefully considering data generating processes (such as sampling issues), and leveraging the rich toolkits of statistics to develop models. We are also adept at mathematical modeling approaches, model calibration, machine learning, and a host of other useful techniques. 

This site links to the software, code and more recent work we have done in our team. 

I believe my trainees should keep their code and packages developed on their own GitHub sites for their own professional development, so this site is meant as a centralized locations to link to the work we generate together.

Funding
-======

We are grateful for funding from the NIH (NIGMS R35GM141821, NIAID P30AI042853) and CDC (NU38FT000013).
